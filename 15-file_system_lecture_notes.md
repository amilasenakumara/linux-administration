# 📂 File System Lecture Notes

Hello beautiful people! In this lecture, we are going to cover **File Systems** in computers.

---

## 1️⃣ What is a File System?

- A **file system** is a system used by a computer operating system to **manage files and directories**.
- It controls **how data is saved and retrieved** from your computer's hard disk.
- 💡 Analogy: A file system is like a **closet**:
  - Shirts go in one section, accessories in another, skirts in another, jackets, shoes, pants, etc.
  - Without organization, everything would be in a mess and hard to find.
  - The file system prevents this clutter by storing files and directories in an **organized and structured way**.

---

## 2️⃣ Purpose of a File System

- Helps the operating system **store files systematically**.
- Examples:
  - System configuration files → one folder
  - User files → another folder
  - Log files → different folder
  - Commands or scripts → separate folder
- 💡 Each type of file system ensures files are easy to retrieve because the OS knows **where to look**.

## 3️⃣ Types of File Systems

### 3.1 Linux File Systems
- **ext3**
- **ext4**
- **ZFS**

### 3.2 Windows File Systems
- **NTFS**
- **FAT**

💡 New OS releases often come with **enhanced file systems** for better performance and organization.

## 4️⃣ File System in Windows

- Example: **Windows 10**
- File Explorer → C: Drive contains predefined folders:
  - `Program Files` & `Program Files (x86)` → installed applications
  - `Users` → stores user profiles
  - System configuration files → dedicated folders
- Benefit: OS retrieves files efficiently since it knows **exact folder locations**.

---

## 5️⃣ File System in Linux

- Everything starts from **root directory `/`**
- Common Linux directories:
  - `/bin` → essential binaries
  - `/boot` → boot loader files
  - `/etc` → configuration files
  - `/home` → user directories
  - `/opt` → optional programs
  - `/sbin` → system binaries and commands
  - `/tmp` → temporary files
  - `/var` → log files
- 💡 Linux has its **own structured way** to save files and directories, similar to Windows but with different organization.

---

## 6️⃣ Key Takeaways

- A **file system organizes files** systematically to avoid clutter.
- Both Windows and Linux have **structured directories** for easier file management.
- Understanding file systems is **essential for system administration and efficient computing**.
- 💡 Analogy: Think of your file system as a **well-organized closet**.
